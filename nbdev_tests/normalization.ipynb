    "The normalization step of Alphaquant is adapted from the [MS-EmpiRe algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA119.001509). It aims at reducing systematic biases between samples. Such biases can for example occur when more material is pipetted in one of the samples. In principle, two steps are performed:\n",

Examples of samples within the same condition could be biological replicates, but also patients with the same clinical condition. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Our assumed input values are log2 transformed peptide ion intensities, which are stored in a 2d numpy array called \"samples\". Each row in samples represents a peptide and each column represents a sample\n",

    "* We then choose the pair of samples with the closest distance between each other\n",
    "* We randomly choose one \"anchor\" sample and one \"shift\" sample and we subtract the distance between the samples from each peptide intensity measured in the \"shift\" sample. This is equivalent to rescaling the intensities of the original sample by a constant factor such that the distributions are aligned\n",
    "* We then construct a virtual \"merged\" sample by computing the average intensities of anchor and shift sample\n",

For the merging we have to take into account the following: If for example the anchor sample has already been merged from 10 samples, and the shift distribution has not been merged at all, we want to weigh the distribution coming from many samples higher. We hence multiply each sample by the number of merges."
