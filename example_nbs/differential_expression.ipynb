    "Peptides that show different quantititative behaviour than other peptides can indicate proteoforms. The logic behind this can be elucidated with a simple example. Let's assume we have a protein with 3 peptides in spleen and testis. The protein itself shows no regulation between the two tissues. Therefore, we can expect that neither of the peptides changes between the conditions. The log2 fold changes for all the peptides should be the same. Now, let's assume that one of the peptides is phosphorylated in testis. If fifty percent of the copies of this peptide carry a phosphorylation, then only half as much **non-modified** peptide should be detectable in testis. This means, that in out spleen_vs_testis condition, we expect the unmodified version of the phosphorylated peptide to be up-regulated, while the other peptides have no regulation. The fold changes should differ. With AlphaQuant, we can investigate systematic differences between fold changes and report peptides that behave differently than expected.\n",
