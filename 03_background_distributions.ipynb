    "# Calculating Background Distributions\n",
    "In order to differentially assess changes of ions/peptides/proteins between conditions, assumptions about the underlying distributions have to be made. This is necessary to distinguish systematic regulation between conditons from random noise. As introduced in the [MS-EmpiRe paper](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA119.001509) and refined in the [EmpiReS paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.234237 ), replicate measurements can be utilized to estimate the empirical *background distributions*, which should reflect the noise underlying the measurements. This approach can then be utilized to:\n",
    "* estimate the background distribtuions in each condition\n",
    "* estimate the background in condition1 - condition2 (i.e. the distribution of fold changes between conditions)\n",
    "* the previous two approaches suffice to perform differential quantification. The approach can however also be used for more complex scenarios. For example, if we want to compare, if two peptides change differently from each other, between two conditions, we can also estimate the underlying background (condition1-condition2)_peptide1 - (condition1-condition2)_peptide2"

    "\n",
    "In the context of AlphaQuant, where proteomics measurements are analysed, we use the word *condition* to describe a set of measurments that was acquired to capture a certain biological state (eg. condition \"native\" as opposed to conditon \"heat shock\"). We try to characterize conditions by sorting their ions by mean intensity (intensity is a good predictor for variation, as described in the [MS-EmpiRe paper](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA119.001509)) and then creating a set of background distributions over the whole intensity range. As a result, we can assign a background distribution to each ion as well as each *differential ion* (i.e. the expected variation in the fold changes of this ion).\n"
